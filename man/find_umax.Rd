\title{Lower bounds on the number of studies with replicated effect}
\usage{
find_umax(
  x,
  alternative = "two-sided",
  t = 0.05,
  confidence = 0.95,
  common.effect = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class 'meta'}

\item{alternative}{'less', 'greater' or 'two-sided'}

\item{t}{truncation threshold for truncated-Pearsons' test (`t=0.05` by default). t is ignored if `common.effect  = TRUE`.}

\item{confidence}{Confidence level used in the computaion of the lower bound(s) \eqn{u_{max}^L} and\\or \eqn{u_{max}^R}.}

\item{common.effect}{Use common.effect = FALSE (default) for replicability-analysis combining with no assumptions (Pearson or truncated-Pearson test).}
}
\value{
An object of class list reporting the bounds on the number of studies with a positive or negative effect, as follows: 
\itemize{
\item{worst.case}{A charachter vector of the names of \code{n-u_{max}+1} studies at which the the \code{r(u_{max})-}value is computed.}
\item{side}{The direction of the replicated signal in the `worst.case` studies. 'less' if the effect is negative, 'greater' if positive.}
\item{u_max}{The bound on the number of studies with either a positive or a negative effect.}
\item{r-value}{The `u-out-of-n` \code{r(u)-}-value calculated with u=u_max.}
\item{Replicability_Analysis}{Report of the replicability lower bounds on the number of studies with negative effect and with positive effect.}
}
}
\description{
lower bounds on the number of studies with increased and\\ or decreased effect.
