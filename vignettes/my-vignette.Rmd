The package `metarep` is an extention to the package `meta`, which allows incorporating replicability-analysis tools to quantify consistency and replicability of treatment effect estimates in a meta-analysis. The tool was proposed by Jaljuli et. al. (submitted) for the fixed-effect and for the random-effects meta-analyses, whith or without the common-effect assumption.  
Here we demonstratethe approach  by implementation  with `metarep`, using examples from systematic reviews Cochrane library. These examples are detailed in the paper as well, along with a demonstration of a way to incorporate our suggestions in standard meta-analysis reporting system.
```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = " "
)
```

We demonstrate the with an example based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis. This example was included in Jaljuli et. al. 2020, found in review number CD002943 in the Cochrane library. This analysis explores the effect of mammogram invitation on attendance during the following 12 months.

```{r example_CD002943}
library(metarep)
data(CD002943_CMP001)

m2943 <- meta::metabin( event.e = N_EVENTS1, n.e = N_TOTAL1, 
                     event.c = N_EVENTS2, n.c = N_TOTAL2,
                     studlab = STUDY, comb.fixed = T , comb.random = F,
                     method = 'Peto', sm = CD002943_CMP001$SM[1],
                     data = CD002943_CMP001)

m2943

summary(m2943)
```


In this meta-analysis, the effect of sending invitation letters was examined in five studies. The authors main result is that: "The odds ratio in relation to the outcome, attendance in response to the mammogram invitation during the 12 months after the invitation, was 1.66 (95% CI 1.43 to 1.92)". 

We suggest reporting the repliability-analysis results alongside: the r-value and lower confidence bounds on the number of studies. 
Results of complete replicability analysis can be added to the contents of a `meta` object or using the function `metarep(...)`, as well as to its summary using `summary( metarep(...) )`. 

To perform assumption-free replicability-analysis requiring replicability in at least `u = 2` (default) studies, we calculate $r(2)-value$ using truncated-Pearsons' test with truncation threshold `t=0.05` (default):


```{r RA Zaykin and bounds22}
(m2943.ra <- metarep(x = m2943 , u = 2 , common.effect = F ,t = 0.05 ,report.u.max = T))
```
Thr bottom two lines report the $r(2)-value$, lower bound on the number of studies with increased effect ($u^L_{max}$) and decreased effect ($u^R_{max}$) , respectively. 
The evidence towards an increased effect was replicable, with $r(2) âˆ’ value = 0.0002$. Moreover, with $95\%$ confidence, we can conclude that at least two studies had an increased effect.
For higher replicability requirement, compute $r(u')-value$ for $u'>2$ using `metarep(u = u' , ... )`.

The two-sided $r(u)-value$ of the model can be accessed via `r.value`: 
```{r rvalue extraction}
m2943.ra$r.value
```

The replicability-analysis reported was performed with an assumption free test, based on truncated-Pearsons' test with truncation level set at the nominal hypothesis testing level (i.e., `t=0.05`, default). For ordinary Pearsons' test, use `t=1`. 

Although the fixed-effect model assumes that all studies are estimates of the same common effect $\theta$, we recommend applying assumption-free replicability-analysis for protection against an (perhaps) unsupported assumption. Despite that, we extend our suggested method with the common-effect incorporation in section 7. This analysis can be performed via `metarep( ... , common.effect = TRUE )`.

`metarep` also allows adding replicability results to the conventional forest plots by `meta`. This can be done by simply applying `meta::forest()` on a `metarep` object. 


```{r forest, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=3}
meta::forest(m2943.ra, layout='revman5',digits.pval = 2 , test.overall = T )
```


The computation of lower bounds on number of studies with replicability of increased \& decreased effects can be supressed using `metarep( ... , report.u.max = FALSE )`


```{r remove_bounds, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=3}
meta::forest( metarep(x = m2943, report.u.max = F ),
              layout='revman5',digits.pval = 2 , test.overall = T )
```


The lower bounds $u^L_{max} \, \text{and} \, u^R_{max}$ are calculated with $1-\alpha = 95\%$ confidence level ( deafalt), meaning that each of the null hypotheses $$H^{u^L_{max}/n}(L) \;\; \text{and}\;\; H^{u^L_{max}/n}(R)$$ is tested at level $\alpha /2 = 2.5\%$, resulting in bounds in overall type error rate $5\%$. Type I error rate can be controlled for any desired $\alpha$ using the argument `confidence = 1 - `$\alpha$.

<!-- Setting `report.u.max = FALSE` can save time when one is only interested in exctracting the $r(u)-value$. The algorithm for computing $u^L_{max} \, \text{and} \, u^R_{max}$ with no assumptions has low complexity of $O( n )$ ( $n$ is the number of studies in the meta-analysis), but it can be quite much when one is performing large amount of replicability analyses at once. However, the computation of these bounds takes $O(2^n)$ if coercing the  $common-effect$ assumption in to the replicability-analysis. -->

The calculation of $u^L_{max} \, \text{and} \, u^R_{max}$ can also be caluclated directly using the function `find_umax()` with the option to specify one-sided alternative, confidence level, truncation threshold and common-effect assumption.
For example, let's compute $u^L_{max}$ with the same confidence level as produced by `m2943.ra.bounds`. 
```{r u_L bound}
find_umax(x = m2943 , common.effect = F,alternative = 'less',t = 0.05,confidence = 0.975)
```
Note that this function produces 2 main types of results: 

1. Worst-case scenario studies: A list  of $n-u_{max}^L+1$  studies names yeilding the maximum
    $$\max_{\forall \{i_1,\dots , i_{n-u+1}\} \subset \{1,\dots , n\} } \{\,p^L_{i_1,\dots , i_{n-u+1}}\,\}$$
1. Replicability-analysis results, amongst: 

    * $u^L_{max}$ or $u^R_{max}$. If `alternative='two-sided'`, then $u_{max}=\max\{u^L_{max}\, , \, u^R_{max}\}$ is also reported.
    
    * $r(u_{max}^L)-value$ or $r(u_{max}^R)-value$  if setting `alternative='less'` or `alternative='greater'`, respectively.
      If `alternative='two-sided'`, then $$rvalue = r(u_{max}) = 2\cdot\min\{r^R(u_{max}^R) , r^L(u_{max}^L) \}$$ is also reported.
    
    For demonstration, see the following example. 
    
```{r u bounds}
find_umax(x = m2943 , common.effect = F,alternative = 'two-sided',t = 0.05,confidence = 0.95)
```


## Replicability analysis using a test-statistic based on
## the common-effect  assumption

```{r RA_with_FE}
find_umax(x = m2943 , common.effect = T,alternative = 'two-sided', confidence = 0.95)

(m2943.raFE <- metarep(x = m2943 , u = 2 , common.effect = T ,report.u.max = T))


```



```{r RA_with_FE_forest, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=3}
find_umax(x = m2943 , common.effect = T,alternative = 'two-sided', confidence = 0.95)

(m2943.raFE <- metarep(x = m2943 , u = 2 , common.effect = T ,report.u.max = T))

meta::forest(m2943.raFE, layout='revman5',digits.pval = 2 , test.overall = T )
```
